# chess-genetic

This is my project where I have used genetic algorithms and stockfish to generate realistic chess puzzles. You can tweak the penalty function to generate whatever type of puzzle you want. Keep in mind to also change the hyper parameters of the genetic algorithm to generate more accurate puzzles.
